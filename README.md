# Self-organizing-bots
A group of small robots capable of assembling themselves built using ESP8266 wifi module and Python.

The platform consists of a collection of custom-designed wheeled robots each 41x35 mm in dimensions, a Wi-Fi module, and object tracking using image processing techniques. They are controlled by custom written algorithms and python libraries. We illustrate the potential of group interface through a set of algorithms implemented with custom designed robots, and discuss general design considerations unique to collective intelligence.


The project can be divided into two different sections,
* Hardware
* Software

# Hardware:

Program uses Nearest-Neighbour Algorithm and custom algorithms for Structure defnitions for the swarm.

Can be applied for ariel and marine robots too.
Just have to change the Interface and Tracking methods for any kind of robotic swarm.
